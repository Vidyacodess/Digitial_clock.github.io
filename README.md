#  Digital Clock

A modern and interactive **Digital Clock** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock features a toggleable 12-hour/24-hour format, a date display, and a light/dark theme switch. This project helps users track real-time updates with added functionality for better user experience.

## Features

- **AM/PM Format Toggle**: Switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The clock updates every second to display the current time.
- **Date Display**: Shows the current date in a "Day, Month Date, Year" format.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for light/dark themes, clock display, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handling dynamic clock updates, time format toggling, and light/dark mode switching.

## How It Works

- The **clock** updates every second using JavaScript’s `setInterval` function.
- The **12-hour/24-hour format toggle** updates the display based on the user's preference.
- The **light/dark mode toggle** switches the background and text color to suit different lighting conditions.
- The **date** is displayed using JavaScript’s `Date` object, showing the current day, month, and year.
